## Web Sites (Usefull in CTFs)
- **Se non trovi la risposta fai generare errori a php**, tipicamente inviando array vuoti: `input=[]` o trasformando in array vuoti: `input[]=`
- Controlla se il confronto Ã¨ fatto con `==` o `===` in tal caso prova a traformare in un altro tipo ad esempio un array...
- **Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability** arises when attackers can access or modify objects by manipulating identifiers used in a web application's URLs or parameters. It occurs due to missing access control checks, which fail to verify whether a user should be allowed to access specific data. (`http://notes.challs.olicyber.it/account/account_number_that_you_want`)
- **File upload possibile**:

  Try to upload the file (with the extensions) that you want:
  - `yoyo.png.php`
  - **Magic Bytes**: search the [specific magic bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) for the file requests, convert and **save** them in a file with [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/) (*from hex*). *Remember to save them in a file creating and saving a new file with cyberchef option*
  - **[Null Byte Injection](https://youtu.be/jBtzFGwHvxE)**: a technique for sending data that would be filtered otherwise. It relies on injecting the null byte characters (`%00`, `\x00`) in the supplied data. Its role is to terminate a string*

  Una volta caricato il file che vuoi puoi provare una [*reverse-shell*](#reverse-shell) or a simple *single command executer* (a small php cmd payload): ```<?=`$_GET[0]`?>```, in order to use it: `www.pippo.it/yo.php?0=command` for example: *http://atlas.picoctf.net:57784/uploads/yoyo.png.php?0=cat ../MFRDAZLDMUYDG.txt*. You can use spaces, dot...
  
  ###### Example 1
  1. An attacker wants to retrieve the file `/etc/passwd` but an extension `.php` is appended automatically such as `/etc/passwd.php`.
  2. The attacker uses the null byte to terminate the string and throw away the `.php` extension: `/etc/passwd%00`
   
  ###### Example 2
   1. An attacker wants to upload a `malicious.php`, but the only extension allowed is `.pdf`.
   2. The attacker constructs the file name such as `malicious.php%00.pdf` and uploads the file.
   3. The application reads the `.pdf` extension, validate the upload, and later throws the end of the string due to the null byte.
   4. The file `malicious.php` is then put in the server.

  ###### [Example 3](https://brandon-t-elliott.github.io/trickster)
- **Redirect Links**: Add `+` at the end of the URL to see the site where the redirect links will bring you: `https://tinyurl.com/bw7t8p4u+`
- **Cookie**
    There are different options:
    - **sniffing** the traffic, so the cookies --> session hijacking if it is the cookie session
    - **session cookie** is in base64, sometimes you can **decode** the cookie and **change** the **user** and sometimes you can copy and paste (session hijacking) or if you don't know what to do brute force or value prediction
    - same hostname shares same cookies
